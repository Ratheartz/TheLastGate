					<h4>Inventor, Lead Programmer, Artist, Tester and Web Site Author <cite>(retired)</cite></h4>
					<p>Daniel Brockhaus alias Ishtar was born in '73 in Bremen/Germany. He moved around quite a bit and eventually found a home in Fischerhude, a small village close to Bremen.
						<br> Somehow he managed to finish school with the <cite>Abitur</cite> and began studying computer science at the University of Bremen. This turned out to be a bad choice. After leaving University, he worked for several years for a local Internet
						Provider. Then he got hired by the tallyman.de AG as Manager of Information Technology. After a year, tallyman was sold to START Ticket, and he was working there for half a year. Now he's spending his time writing a successor to Mercenaries.</p>
					<br><br>

					<h4>Programmer and Administrator <cite>(retired)</cite></h4>
					<p>Carl Smotricz alias Elrac makes his living as a freelance programmer. He's been in the business for more years than he cares to remember.</p>

					<h4>Administrator</h4>
					<p>Pierre-Marc Bussiere alias Lancelot is studying Computer Science. He's also a freelance Web Designer.
					</p>

					<h4>Programmer</h4>
					<p>John Michael Carolan alias Resrunu is studying Electronics &amp; Engineering. He's learning to build those little chips which make your computer tick.</p>

					<h4>Additional Artists</h4>
					<p>Several of the new graphics are from Markus R&ouml;der, some of the first graphics were done by Jens F&auml;hrmann.</p>

					<h4>Testing &amp; Area Building</h4>
					<p>Special thanks go to <cite>Calibus</cite>, <cite>Chojing</cite>,
						<cite>Hector</cite>, <cite>Herix</cite>, <cite>Incineration</cite>,
						<cite>Malek</cite>, <cite>Kascor</cite>, <cite>Mylady</cite>,
						<cite>Sharra</cite>, <cite>Tiritz</cite> and
						<cite>Warlock</cite>. Their suggestions and bug reports have been very valuable.
