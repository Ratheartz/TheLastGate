					<h3>Playing Guidelines</h3>
					<h4>Dealing with the Gods</h4>
					<p>
						Remember that the gods are keeping this game online just for fun. Don't bother them with questions or requests which aren't essential.<br> If you have a question, try to ask it when the gods aren't busy. A good sign for this is that they're in the
						<cite>Temple of Skua</cite>. Go there and ask them in person.<br> Whatever it is you want the god to answer or do, be absolutely honest and do not insist on getting your request fullfilled. If you break one of these rules, very bad things might
						happen to you.
					</p>
					</p>
					<h4>Quests and Quest Items</h4>
					<p>
						You are not allowed to give quest items or the answers to riddles to players who haven't solved the corresponding quest yet. This includes guiding newbies into areas which are way too dangerous for them alone. Solving quests is a major part of the game,
						and if you're giving away the solutions, you're spoiling the fun for the new players.
					</p>
					<h4>Abuse of Bugs</h4>
					<p>
						Should you discover a bug, you have to inform us (<a href="mailto:pyroflyx@gmail.com">pyroflyx@gmail.com</a>) as soon as possible. Do not exploit the bug. The server writes an extensive logfile. We will notice
						and remove any advantage you gained through the bug.
					</p>
					<h4>Language</h4>
					<p>
						The game language is english. Please speak english while you're playing. Talking in another language is only acceptable if your whole company knows that language.
					</p>
					<h4>Player Killing</h4>
					<p>
						Player killing is optional. If you want it, you have to enable it for your account. Once enabled, you can kill other players who have enabled it as well. And they can kill you.
					</p>
					<h4>Social Behaviour</h4>
					<p>
						Remember that this is a game all of us are playing to have fun. Try not to spoil it. Do we have to say more? (Breaking this rule is the best way to get your account canceled and your site banned).
					</p>
					<h4>Reliability</h4>
					<p>
						There is absolutely no guaranty that the game will be playable It's quite likely that it will be, but we don't promise anything. <b>Please</b> report all problems, oddities or whatever as soon as possible via email to <a href="mailto:pyroflyx@gmail.com">pyroflyx@gmail.com</a>!
					</p>
					<h4>Accounts</h4>
					<p>
						Accounts are deleted if they are deemed inactive. Besides that, <b>we reserve the right to cancel any account at any time for any reason.</b><br> It is your responsibility to store your account in safe place. If someone steals it and does bad things
						to (or with) your account, you're still responsible. If you manage to lose your account, it is lost. Sorry folks, we do not have the time to check if it really is yours and email it to you.
